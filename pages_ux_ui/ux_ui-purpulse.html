                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, with seizures often triggered by environmental factors such as flashing lights, loud noises, and crowded spaces. Concerts, while thrilling for many, can be anxiety-inducing for those with epilepsy due to these sensory triggers. The unpredictability of seizure-inducing factors forces many to avoid live music events altogether, missing out on unique, memorable experiences.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Hypothesis: Individuals with epilepsy may forgo attending concerts due to fear of potential seizures triggered by flashing lights, loud sounds, or other environmental stimuli.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
                    <p>
                        To create a solution that empowers individuals with epilepsy to confidently attend concerts by reducing the unpredictability of potential seizure triggers. To design a seamless experience that integrates with live concert setups, providing real-time alerts and information to users about potential triggers.

                    <p>
                        We delved into existing studies on the relationship between epilepsy and sensory stimuli, including the risks posed by flashing lights, loud noises, and stroboscopic effects. 
                        <br>Studies from sources like the Journal of Neuroscience revealed that concert lighting, especially in electronic dance music (EDM) settings, can be a significant seizure trigger.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Community Insights</h3>
                    <p>
                        We explored epilepsy-focused communities such as Reddit, where individuals shared their personal concert experiences, challenges, and coping mechanisms when exposed to intense lighting or sound stimuli during live events. Their experiences highlighted the need for real-time information and sensory management solutions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Interviews</h3>
                    <p>
                        We conducted interviews with people living with epilepsy, asking about their concert experiences, triggers, and how they manage their condition in public settings. Key questions focused on how they prepare for events, any negative experiences they've encountered, and how they think concerts could be made more inclusive.

                        Most individuals indicated that unpredictable lighting effects, such as strobes or sudden flashes, were significant triggers.

                    <h3>Lack of Information</h3>
                        <p>
                            Concert-goers with epilepsy often felt unprepared due to the lack of available information about the sensory environment of a venue or event.
